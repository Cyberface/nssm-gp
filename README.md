This repo provides [`gpflow`](https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow) implementation of the non-stationary spectral kernels, in the following two papers
 * Neural Non-Stationary Spectral Kernel
   * Sami Remes, Markus Heinonen, Samuel Kaski
   * Preprint at [arXiv:1811.10978](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10978)
   
 * Non-Stationary Spectral Kernels
   * Sami Remes, Markus Heinonen, Samuel Kaski
   * [NIPS 2017](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7050-non-stationary-spectral-kernels)
   
Some documentation will be included ASAP, most of the code and datasets should be available here.
